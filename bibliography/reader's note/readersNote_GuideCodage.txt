-------------------------------
Summary : This document is a coding guid for C++ inspired, adapted and translated from Geosoft C++ Programming Style Guidelines ( http://geosoft.no/development/cppstyle.html ). It is here to normalize the coding style. The goal was to put clearly some of the most important items for futur code refactoring.

-------------------------------
Memory items to remember :
-1 : lisibility first (if not following makes for better lisibility, do not follow)
-2 : class names are in PascalCase
-3 : variable in camelCase
-4 : constant name is in UPPER_SNAKE
-5 : methods is camelCase beginning with verb
-9 : abreviation in minuscule when used in variable
-12 : generic variable should have their type name in their name
-13 : either all english or all french
-14 : temporary variable should have short names whereas long used ones can have longer
-21 : using plurals for collections of object
-22 : prefix n should be used for variable indicating a number of object
-25 : bool method/variable should begin with is/has/must
-27 : avoiding abreviation
-29 : negative name (isNot...) should be avoided
-32 : function should be name after what they return and methods after what they do
-36 : avoiding long line
-44 : declared variable should be initialized
-50 : keeping variables in their use block
-52 : initializing loop-variable just before loop
-56 : replacing complex conditionnal expression by temporary bool variable
-57 : with if-else, if should be the most common case
-60 : avoid "magic number", constant should be initialized as constant
-79 : separating logic unit with an empty line
-80 : separating methods with 3 empty line
-85 : using only // to comment
