-------------------------------
Summary : Historic document ( url : https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3151h/f337.item ). Original discussion of the second algorithm of Remez with the different implicated theorems and results of De La Vall√©e-Poussin. Talk about the bottleneck-convergence of the two steps errors. Has an example with abs(x) in [-1,1] with n = 2, 3, 4, 5.

-------------------------------

Memory items to remember : -I think it may correspond to version + as the taken points were the n+2 maxima and minima of the error. (see page 339, towards the end)
