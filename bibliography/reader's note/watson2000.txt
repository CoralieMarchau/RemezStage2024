Article title : Approximation in normed linear spaces
Year of publication : 2000
Author(s) : G.A Watson

-------------------------------
Summary : An historical amount of approximation focused on linear and non-linear approximation of real. Mainly talks about univariate though comments on multivariate case are presented. Most of the article is descriptive as it is its attention.

Memory items to remember :
-Loads of source material is referenced in the article. It may be interesting to investigate some of them (example : Borel 1905 (source 28) as it establish the alternation result and uniqueness of solution for the univariate case. Or Osborne and Watson 1969 (151) with the singular problems)/
-no chebyshev set above dimension one (pointed out by Mairhuber 1956 (119))
-phi(x) respect Haar if chebyshev set
-the two previous points partial explanation of the number of singularity in multivariate pb
