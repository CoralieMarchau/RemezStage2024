Welcome to the summary of BasicRemez 1 for univariate polynomial approximation. 
With the following parameters : 
degree of approximation = 1
size of first discretization =3
maximum number of turns = 100
approximation of error = 1.00001e-10
approximation of points = 1.00001e-15
x in [-1,1]
For the function x*x.
Step 1: 
D=[-1,0,1]
Polynom = [0.5,0] 
Error step1 =0.5
Step 2: 
D=[-1,0,1]
