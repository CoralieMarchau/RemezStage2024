Welcome to the summary of BasicRemez 1 for univariate polynomial approximation. 
With the following parameters : 
degree of approximation = 5
size of first discretization =5
maximum number of turns = 100
approximation of error = 1.00001e-10
approximation of points = 1.00001e-15
x in [0.0100001,1]
For the function abs(x).
Step 1: 
D=[0.0100001,0.257501,0.505001,0.752501,1]
Polynom = [4.436e-19,1.000000000001,0,0,0,2.173886891227e-16]
